# Custom-Hello-World-Syscall-in-Ubuntu-Linux
This project demonstrates the creation of a custom "Hello World" system call (syscall) in the Linux kernel running on Ubuntu. It provides all the steps involved in modifying the kernel source, adding a new syscall, rebuilding the kernel, and testing the syscall by writing a simple C program to invoke it.
